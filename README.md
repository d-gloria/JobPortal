# JobPortal

Job Portal Application is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to manage job postings, user registrations, and applications efficiently. It follows the MVC architecture with a structured package design, including controllers, services, and repositories. 

Built using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and REST APIs, this project provides a scalable backend for a job portal. Future enhancements may include authentication, role-based access, and front-end integration. The project uses Spring Security for authentication and Spring Data JPA for database management.
